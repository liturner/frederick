ToDo: Write an End User License Agreement...

This license must ensure that an agreement is described with 
relation to the DSVGO and any other legal aspects.

In the software, any user MUST agree to this EULA.

We must also document here the efforts gone into enforcing
that this EULA is read.

We must also document liability, authority and 
responsibility.

In comparison to the License used for development (between
us and other developers), this license is between us ant the
end user.
