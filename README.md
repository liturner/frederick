# Project Aims

We aim to provide a set of tools to help with the missions and deployments of the German Federal Agency for Technical Relief. The project aims to produce software which fulfills stringent security and data protection checks.

- Stability of the software is preferred over quantity of features.
- The software should only be configurable where neccassary.
- The software is to be used in emergency situations. Pretty comes second to fast.
